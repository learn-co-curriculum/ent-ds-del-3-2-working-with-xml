    "## eXtensible Markup Language\n",
    "\n",
    "XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a way of taking information and making it very easy for computers to read and process it. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<people>\n",
    "    <person>\n",
    "        <firstname>Jane</firstname>\n",
    "        <lastname>Anderson</lastname>\n",
    "        <phone type=\"cell\">111-111-1111</phone>\n",
    "    </person>\n",
    "    <person>\n",
    "        <firstname>Joe</firstname>\n",
    "        <lastname>Sonos</lastname>\n",
    "        <phone type=\"office\">111-111-1111</phone>\n",
    "    </person>\n",
    "    <person>\n",
    "        <firstname>Alison</firstname>\n",
    "        <lastname>Demming</lastname>\n",
    "        <phone type=\"home\">111-111-1111</phone>\n",
    "    </person>\n",

    "```\n",
    "You will see that there are a set of Elements denoted by words surrounded by angle brackets (they're called tags).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also see that each Element starts with a tag and ends with the same tag but with a backslash - so a person starts with the `<person>` tag and ends with the `</person>` tag. You'll also notice that Elements can be nested - so the firstname Element is nested within each of the three person Elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll notice that in addition to Elements that have values (e.g. the first firstname element has a value of `Jane`), there are also attributes. In the example above the only attribute is a `type` attribute on the phone Element, allowing us to distinguish between home, work and cell phones. The difference between a value and an attribute is that a value is contained between the opening and closing tags - e.g. `<firstname>Alison</firstname>`, whereas an attribute is written *within* the opening tag for an element - e.g. `<phone type=\"office\">`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "* **What is the second Element for each of the people?**\n",
    "* **Which is the only Element in the document with an attribute?**\n",

    "## The Problem it Solves - Structured, Hierarchical Data Description\n",
    "It's important to understand the kinds of problems that XML *(or JSON - they both solve the same problem just using different syntax)* is optimized to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best for Structured Data\n",
    "Unstructured data is something like a book or an essay - lots of words, but free form text. While unstructured data can be contained within an XML document, the strength of XML documents is in describing structured information. Structured information is where the information is broken down into types of data. So for example, I could write an unstructured essay describing a person, but I could also create a structured document describing attributes of the person such as their first name, last name, date of birth and home phone number. Such a document could be a good use case for being stored in an XML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best for Hierarchical Data\n",
    "Lets say we wanted to store structured information on a list of people with their first name, last name and phone number. How could we store that? We would probably do what we've done to date. Have a csv file with column names in the first row. That would be easy to read (for either a person or a computer) and would work perfectly. So for simple structured data (that fits neatly into a simple single sheet in a spreadsheet with one type of data per column), you probably don't need to use XML *(although sometimes such information is provided using XML anyway)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real strength of XML is for hierarchical data. Imagine now that we have information about a list of people. But in addition to having their first name, last name and phone number, we also have a list of one or more addresses for each person. Now how would we store and share that information?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know that nobody has more than (say) three addresses, we could just add a bunch of extra columns to the csv file with names like address1_street, address1_city, address1_state, address1_zip, address2_street, address2_city and so on. But what happens if some people have 20 addresses and some have none? It's a pretty inefficient way of storing the information adding twenty sets of columns, and if you suddenly find that one of the people has 21 addresses, you need to change the structure of the file and anyone working with the file will have to rewrite their scripts to handle the extra fields for that twenty first address.\n",
    "\n",
    "With XML, it's easy. Each person can have a collection of zero or more addresses, so we might take the example above and edit it to become:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<people>\n",
    "    <person>\n",
    "        <firstname>Jane</firstname>\n",
    "        <lastname>Anderson</lastname>\n",
